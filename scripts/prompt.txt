Generate synthetic time-series sensor data that mimics the structure and dynamics of human motion sensor readings.
The dataset must have exactly 7 columns:

Timestamp: ISO 8601 format, incrementing sequentially every 0.5 seconds.

Accel_x, Accel_y, Accel_z: 3-axis accelerometer readings (float values typically between -20 and 20 m/s²).

Gyro_x, Gyro_y, Gyro_z: 3-axis gyroscope readings (float values typically between -5 and 5 °/s).

Requirements:

Preserve realistic correlations across axes (e.g., smooth transitions, short-term oscillations).

Maintain consistent sampling rate and time continuity.

Add natural measurement noise (±0.1 for accelerometer, ±0.01 for gyroscope).

Generate at least 10000 consecutive rows.

Output in CSV format with header row.
